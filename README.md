> ### About This Repository
> This is the **full-featured version** of Techflow, including the Task Management System. The production-deployed version lives in a separate repository.
>
> The Task Management System (EEG orders, patient room tracking, procedure checklists) is not included in the production version as a deliberate compliance decision. Tracking patient room assignments and procedure-level data requires a formal HIPAA compliance review before deployment in a clinical environment. This repository preserves the full feature set for portfolio and demonstration purposes.

> ### Production Deployment
>[![Techflow](https://img.shields.io/badge/Techflow-Repo-30b5b2?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/mariomujica99/techflow)  
> **Want to explore just the production tools?**  
> The production-deployed version is the same core platform with multi-department support built in.

## Overview

**Techflow** is a full-stack Progressive Web App designed specifically for **EEG (Electroencephalography) Technologists** working in hospital neurophysiology departments. The system addresses real-world challenges in managing complex medical procedures by providing:

- Digital workflow management replacing paper-based task tracking
- Real-time team coordination through interactive whiteboards
- Equipment monitoring for an overview of issues with inactive equipment
- Inventory tracking for medical supplies across multiple storage locations
- Role-based access control separating admin and member responsibilities

This application was built to demonstrate my full-stack development skills including authentication, complex state management, file uploads, data visualization, and responsive design.

**The Problems:**
- Manual Whiteboards: Staff must navigate through a chat to find the whiteboard picture of the day
- Communication Gaps: No centralized system for supply needs, leading to delays and out of stock supplies
- Information: Important images and reference materials not centralized
- Task Visibility: Difficult to track what's been completed versus what needs attention, especially across shifts
- Equipment Issues: Computer station problems aren't consistently documented or tracked

**Solution:** Techflow brings everything related to our department into one central, accessible location. Think of it as a digital command center for EEG operations.

### **Database Schema Design**

**7 Core Collections:**
1. **Users** - Team members with authentication
2. **Tasks** - EEG orders with embedded todo sub-documents
3. **Providers** - Reading physicians
4. **ComStations** - Equipment tracking
5. **Supplies** - Inventory by storage room
6. **Whiteboards** - Daily assignments with user/provider references
7. **Files** - Document hierarchy with folder support

**Key Relationships:**
- Tasks → Users (many-to-many via assignedTo array)
- Tasks → ComStations (one-to-one reference)
- Whiteboards → Users (many-to-many via coverage arrays)
- Whiteboards → Providers (one-to-one via readingProviders)
- Files → Users (one-to-many via uploadedBy)
- Files → Files (self-referential for folder hierarchy)

---

## Frontend

### **State Management Strategy**
- **Context API** for global user authentication state
- **Local State** (useState) for component-specific data
- **Session Storage** for warning dismissal tracking
- **Local Storage** for JWT token persistence

### **Routing Architecture**
- **Public Routes:** Login, Sign Up
- **Private Routes (Members):** Dashboard, Tasks, Whiteboards, View-only access
- **Private Routes (Admins):** All member routes + Manage Tasks, Delete operations, Reports
- **Role-based redirects** on login based on user role

### **Responsive Design Approach**
- **Mobile-First** Tailwind CSS classes
- **Breakpoints:** sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px), 2xl (1536px), 3xl (1920px)
- **Touch-Optimized** UI elements for mobile devices
- **Viewport Fit** for notched devices (iPhone X+)
- **Safe Area Insets** for PWA installation

*B.S. in Neuroscience*

I’m a full-stack developer with a clinical background in neurodiagnostics and a Bachelor’s degree in Neuroscience. I specialize in building modern web applications that solve real-world operational challenges in complex domains such as the neurophysiology department.

Techflow reflects both my technical skill set and my firsthand understanding of EEG department workflows, bridging clinical insight with scalable software design.
